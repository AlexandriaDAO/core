/*  
Goal:
 Generate a feed for the whole app that goes like this:
 - Queryies a random SBT. (simple fast randomness that does not require an update call, and can be predictable).
   - Has 40% chance of looking displaying one of it's shelves.

Actually, I could do this all in the frontend.
- Query random SBTs to display.
- Display their appears_in shelves. 

That's it.
