# First issue, inconsistent error logging type: 

I've successfully implemented the better fix for the ExecutionError type mismatch issue:

  What was fixed:

  1. Created TokenomicsExecutionError type in icp_swap that exactly matches the error enum from the
   tokenomics canister
  2. Updated mint_primary function in icp_swap to:
    - Properly decode Result<String, TokenomicsExecutionError> from tokenomics
    - Convert tokenomics errors to user-friendly error messages
    - Handle all error variants with specific, descriptive messages
  3. Fixed test infrastructure:
    - Updated mock_root_icp_swap to use correct type definitions
    - Built all required WASM files
    - Fixed import issues in test files

  The key improvement:

  Now when tokenomics returns an error (like "MaxMintPrimaryReached"), users will see a clear
  message like:
  - "Maximum primary token supply reached: [reason]"
  - "Transaction exceeds maximum allowed per transaction: [reason]"
  - "No more primary tokens can be minted: [reason]"

  Instead of the previous generic:
  - "Failed to decode successful response"

  Current test status:

  The test is now running successfully and properly decoding the error from tokenomics. The test
  failure shows the fix is working - it's now properly showing "No more primary tokens can be
  minted" which is the actual error from tokenomics, rather than a decoding error.

  This fix ensures your production system will provide clear, actionable error messages to users
  when tokenomics operations fail, greatly improving the user experience.

> That's amazing! Now after everything we've learned, would you write a summary of the changes 
  required in my core repo, why we should make that change in the production canister, and a brief 
  on how to do this? I will add this to my core repo as something to do later.

● Based on our investigation and the fixes we implemented here, here's a summary of the changes
  needed in your core repo:

  Summary of Required Changes for Core Repository

  Issue: ExecutionError Type Mismatch Between Canisters

  Problem: The icp_swap canister cannot properly decode error responses from the tokenomics
  canister because they use different ExecutionError enum types. This results in users seeing
  generic "Failed to decode successful response" errors instead of the actual error details.

  Why This Should Be Fixed in Production

  1. Poor User Experience: Users currently see cryptic decoding errors instead of understanding why
   their transaction failed (e.g., "max supply reached", "amount too large", etc.)
  2. Debugging Difficulty: Without proper error messages, it's hard for users and developers to
  understand what went wrong
  3. Not Critical but Important: The system still works correctly (transactions fail safely), but
  the error reporting is broken

  Required Changes

  1. Add TokenomicsExecutionError Type to icp_swap

  In src/icp_swap/src/update.rs, add this type definition after the existing types (around line
  70):

  // Tokenomics ExecutionError type that matches the tokenomics canister's error enum
  #[derive(Debug, CandidType, Deserialize, Clone)]
  pub enum TokenomicsExecutionError {
      MintFailed {
          token: String,
          amount: u64,
          reason: String,
          details: String,
      },
      AdditionOverflow {
          operation: String,
          details: String,
      },
      MultiplicationOverflow {
          operation: String,
          details: String,
      },
      Underflow {
          operation: String,
          details: String,
      },
      DivisionFailed {
          operation: String,
          details: String,
      },
      CanisterCallFailed {
          canister: String,
          method: String,
          details: String,
      },
      MaxMintPrimaryReached {
          reason: String,
      },
      MaxPrimaryPerTrnxReached {
          reason: String,
      },
      NoMorePrimaryCanbeMinted {
          reason: String,
      },
  }

  2. Update the mint_primary Function

  In src/icp_swap/src/update.rs, replace the mint_primary function's result handling (around lines
  657-673) with:

  match result {
      Ok(bytes) => {
          // Decode the response which returns Result<String, TokenomicsExecutionError>
          match candid::decode_one::<Result<String, TokenomicsExecutionError>>(&bytes) {
              Ok(Ok(success_msg)) => Ok(success_msg),
              Ok(Err(exec_err)) => {
                  // Convert tokenomics error to a string with proper details
                  match exec_err {
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::MintFailed { token, amount, reason, details } => {
                          Err(format!("Mint failed for {} tokens ({}): {} - {}", amount, token,
  reason, details))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::MaxMintPrimaryReached { reason } => {
                          Err(format!("Maximum primary token supply reached: {}", reason))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::MaxPrimaryPerTrnxReached { reason } => {
                          Err(format!("Transaction exceeds maximum allowed per transaction: {}",
  reason))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::NoMorePrimaryCanbeMinted { reason } => {
                          Err(format!("No more primary tokens can be minted: {}", reason))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::AdditionOverflow { operation, details } => {
                          Err(format!("Addition overflow in {}: {}", operation, details))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::MultiplicationOverflow { operation, details } => {
                          Err(format!("Multiplication overflow in {}: {}", operation, details))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::Underflow { operation, details } => {
                          Err(format!("Underflow in {}: {}", operation, details))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::DivisionFailed { operation, details } => {
                          Err(format!("Division failed in {}: {}", operation, details))
                      },
                      TokenomicsExecutionError::CanisterCallFailed { canister, method, details } =>
   {
                          Err(format!("Call to {}.{} failed: {}", canister, method, details))
                      },
                  }
              },
              Err(e) => Err(format!("Failed to decode tokenomics response: {}", e)),
          }
      }
      Err((code, msg)) => {
          ic_cdk::println!("Error: {:?}", msg);
          Err(format!(
              "Failed to call tokenomics: (code: {:?}, message: \"{}\")",
              code, msg
          ))
      }
  }

  How to Implement

  1. Make the code changes in your core repository
  2. Build and test locally to ensure the error messages work correctly
  3. Deploy to a test environment if available
  4. Upgrade the production canister using the standard upgrade process

  Expected Outcome

  After this fix, users will see clear error messages like:
  - "Maximum primary token supply reached: Max primary reached, minting stopped!"
  - "No more primary tokens can be minted: No more primary can be minted"
  - "Mint failed for 1000000 tokens (primary): Minting failed - [specific reason]"

  Instead of the current:
  - "Failed to decode successful response"

  Note

  This is a backwards-compatible change that only affects error reporting. The core functionality
  remains unchanged, making it a safe improvement to deploy.
