General:

1. What is Alexandria?

Alexandria is a experimental protocol. This website is our pilot program.

Our goal is to is to restore that sense of awe and human connection that was so palpable in the early days of the Web by reimagining the FAANG services for Web3. In one sense, we're the ultimate library for permanent content. In another sense, we're a protocol layer for dapps where everything is an NFT with built-in nanopayments.

2. Is this site safe?

Our core tokenomics has been audited and rigorously tested with no known issues, and so while mistakes are always possible, fucntions relating to $alex and $lbry (swap/burn/stake/send) are exceedingly unlikely to result in loss of funds.

That said, the rest of this platform is pre-alpha, unaudited, and rapidly changing. It is possible that funds inside NFTs and  'topup' accounts could be lost in a major failure event, so it is recommended to collect them frequently while we continue work on a backup system.

Alexandria is a fair launched community project. It's tokens $alex and $lbry are speculative and could go to zero.

1. How do I register an account?

First, you need to get an [Internet Identity](https://identity.ic0.app/).

Then login with II, click 'SignUp', and add your username. This makes you a Librarian - someone who can store, share, and collect content on Alexandria.

4. Why do I need LBRY?

On Alexandria everything's an NFT, so using other people's content is not free. You pay to use others' content in LBRY, and get paid when your content is used.

LBRY always costs $0.01 to mint with ICP, making costs predictable.

5. Can I use the platform without tokens?

Yes, you just can't save anything permanently.

Swap:

1. How do I get ALEX?

There are three ways:
- Buy on the open market.
- Burn LBRY on the 'Swap' page.
- Collect it from your NFTs.

2. What happens when I 'swap'?

You send ICP to the staking pool, and recieve LBRY in return.

3. What happens when I 'burn'?

You burn LBRY and recieve half their value back in ICP. You also recieve newly minted ALEX according to the current block reward.

Additionally, two other random NFTs recieve the same ALEX mint: (1) To a randomly selected Scion NFT from the last 1000 minted and (2) to the parent OG NFT.

4. What happens when I 'topup'?

You give this app the right to spend that LBRY when you mint NFTs.

5. Why is the token set up like this?

It is the fairest way to reward platform contributors, which is at the foundation of our vision. Read the whitepaper for more details.

Apps:

1. How do I get LBRY?

"Swap" for it, and 'topup' to use it in our apps.

2. What is Alexandrian?

An interface for your NFT library, and those of others.

3. What is Permasearch?

An assets centric block explorer for the Arweave blockchain. You could look up any transaction, see the corresponding asset, and mint it as an NFT.

4. What is Emporium?

An NFT marketplace.

5. What apps are coming soon?

- A decentralized social network, search engine, ereader, and video streaming service to start.

NFTs:

1. How do I mint NFTs?

Use the search button on our apps, and click 'Mint'.

2. What can I do with my NFTs?

You could share them, and collect ALEX and LBRY from them if they are liked by others.

3. Can I upload my own NFTs?

Not yet, but very soon.

4. What are SBTs?

Soul-Bound Tokens, meaning they are part of your profile and cannot be transferred. On Alexandria, they are a copy of an original NFT that allows you to use that content as your own (since you paid for it, and auto-reference the original).

5. Are my NFTs safe?

Kindof yes. Our NFT implementations are not audited, but they are backed up regularly, so restorable. Their underlying assets, being on Arweave, have guaranteed permanence.
