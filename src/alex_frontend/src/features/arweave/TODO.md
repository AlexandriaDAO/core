/*
Notes:
 - It does a good job with Hentai.

- I'm pretty sure it considered a regular blurred out image to be porn, which is fine I guess. 
- It thinks most nude photagraphy are regular drawings.


- It identified a nude painting as 54% porn. So that's interesting.

- It's also finding a lot of sexy pictures (non-nude) to be neutral. 
- It made a landscape photo 80+% porn so.
*/


Initial Conditions: 

- If porn >50%
- If sexy and porn are both >20%
- Hentai above 25%


More Conditions: 

- If porn >15% && sexy >2% && Hentai > 2%

- If sexy by itself is >50? (or maybe find another condition to match with so we don't censor paintings/art)

Or even lower for hentai. 10% or less. There's lots of anime porn getting through.
Actually this is getting tricky. There's this beautiful painting that's considered hentai.
