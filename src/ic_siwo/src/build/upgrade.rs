/// Required fields are `domain`, `uri`, and `salt`. All other fields are optional.

/// ## ðŸ›‘ Important: Changing the `salt` or `uri` setting affects how user seeds are generated.
/// This means that existing users will get a new principal id when they sign in. Tip: Don't change the `salt` or `uri`
/// settings after users have started using the service!

// post upgrade will only run when the code inside this canister is updated
// so if you wanna update settings, you need to update something in code first
// if you deploy with new arguments and don't change the code,
// build process will produce a hash of module which is already installed and upgrade will not run
