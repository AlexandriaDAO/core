First, I tried creating an asset canister using my local asset_canister Wasm file, but it was not showing the available functions. At first, I thought it was an issue with my code, so I tried multiple other approaches. Then, I did some research and found this thread: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ic-management-create-canister-type-asset/6703. Initially, the compiled Wasm file was not appearing in the target/release directory. Once it was generated, I extracted the Wasm file, deployed it as the canister code, and it finally workedâ€”showing all the functions of the asset_canister.
