The Plan:

- Color code the tags.
- Alexandria query. (Query token amounts, then only the amount on the page (rather than all at once))
- Delay in mint button on alexandrian is weird.

Next Small Stuff:

- Alexandrian search needs to use the state of the current page number.
- Play button on videos by default. (fix broken videos)
- There's a bug where ebook searching gets the search button stuck in the loading state.
- Remove duplicates based on file size.
- More advanced searching with tags and metadata.
- Mint button has some load time issues on Alexandrian.
- Rank by tokens in the NFT.




Next Big Stuff:
- Add the icrc3 canisters to the cycles manager.

- Apps page leaderboard of top NFTs (perhaps from a backup system off-chain)
- Then we'll let people do their own channels which are just regular stable structures and no economic incentive. 
These channels could be open for everyone to edit, or only for the owner to edit.
I think it'll be totally free to add nfts, but you can only add them if you own the original or copy.









### Adding channels/blocks/collections to sort NFTs.

Metrics: 
9.97T Cycles in ICP Swap at 830 am, and it's dispersing once per minute.
9.765T Cycles at 7am the next day. (But it could also be that it's because it stopped distributing.)
9.470 Several days later (12/16), right before deploying tests canister. (the tests canister itself has 8.81T cycles at noon before deployment)
12/19 (3 days later): icp_swap is at 9.025 and tests is at 7.411.

Topup Records:
- ALEX lost 10T cycles in the 15 hours after launch. I topped it up to 50T Cycles.
- LBRY lost 10T cycles in the 15 hours after launch. I topped it up to 50T Cycles.
