The Plan:

- Block the manager page if it's not fixed by tomorrow.

Next Small Stuff: 
- There's a bug where ebook searching gets the search button stuck in the loading state.
- Add Milliseconds place to permasearch. 
- Remove duplicates based on file size.
- More advanced searching with tags and metadata.
- Take alexandrian principals from the backend Librarian profiles list.




Next Big Stuff:
Then we'll let people do their own channels which are just regular stable structures and no economic incentive. 
These channels could be open for everyone to edit, or only for the owner to edit.
I think it'll be totally free to add nfts, but you can only add them if you own the original or copy.









### Adding channels/blocks/collections to sort NFTs.

Metrics: 
9.97T Cycles in ICP Swap at 830 am, and it's dispersing once per minute.
9.765T Cycles at 7am the next day. (But it could also be that it's because it stopped distributing.)
9.470 Several days later (12/16), right before deploying tests canister. (the tests canister itself has 8.81T cycles at noon before deployment)
12/19 (3 days later): icp_swap is at 9.025 and tests is at 7.411.
